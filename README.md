# GIS Mining Application

This Python repository houses a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) application tailored for mining data analysis. The application leverages the GDAL library for spatial data handling and Matplotlib for visualization.

## Features

- **GeoTIFF Handling:** Read and visualize GeoTIFF files.
- **Basic Analysis:** Perform basic operations on spatial mining data.
- **GDAL Integration:** Utilize GDAL functionalities for GIS-based analysis.

## Usage

1. **Setup:**
   - Ensure GDAL and Matplotlib are installed in your Python environment.

2. **Execution:**
   - Modify the file path in the code to point to your GeoTIFF file.
   - Run the script to visualize spatial mining data.
